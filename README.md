# My mod of [apify-cli](https://github.com/apify/apify-cli)

- Brainstorming new features and dog-fooding them.
- Not ready for a prime time â€“ not caring about completeness, performance, nor stability.
- You probably don't want to use this and expect it to work.
- Keeping everything in master and rebasing, for simplicity, don't judge me.
