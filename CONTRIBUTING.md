# Contributing to apify-cli

## Tests

Tests are implemented using the [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) framework.
You need to have Apify account to test all apify-cli features.

Then you can run tests with commands in repository root directory:

1. Install all dependencies:
`npm install`

2. Logout your current Apify account if you used some:
`apify logout`

3. Run tests using credentials of the 'apify-test' user:
`TEST_USER_ID=<apifyUserId> TEST_TOKEN=<apifyUserApiToken> npm run test`

## Publish new version

Only users with access to [apify-cli package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apify-cli) can publish new version.

1. Before publishing new version you have to generate and commit production `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
`npm run prod-shrinkwrap`
NOTE: File `package-lock.json` will be completely ignored during package publishing. Using `npm-shrinkwrap.json` will correctly lock dependencies.

2. Create manifest file `npm run manifest`

3. Generate command reference to `README.md`:
`npm run commands-md`

4. Merge the PR with your changes to master. This will trigger release of `beta` version.

5. If the beta version works properly, create new release. This will publish `latest` version.
